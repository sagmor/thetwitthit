= TheTwittHit

I'm a GTD fan and the idea is simple, i want my contacts to be able to post things they need me to do in my inbox and also post thing by my self when I'm away from my computer.

So i integrated {The Hit List}[http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/], the application i use to manage my todo list and {Twitter}[http://twitter.com/] and created TheTwittHit

TheTwittHit is a simple script that collects twitts with the hashtag *#todo* from twitter that either were:

 * Posted by you
 * Replied to you
 * Direct Messaged to you

and add them to the application's inbox were i can review them later.

== Install

Just open a terminal and write:

  sudo gem install sagmor-thetwitthit --source http://gems.github.com
  thetwitthit install

follow the instructions and you are ready to go

== Usage

Once you had configured it simply {twitt using the #todo hashtag}[http://twitter.com/home?status=%23todo] and see how TheTwittHit do the rest
